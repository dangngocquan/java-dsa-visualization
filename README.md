## Features

### 1. Sort Algorithms

#### 1.1. Sort algorithms 

Sort Algorithms will be executed on an array with 6 features:

- `Shuffle`: Shuffle position of elements in current array.
- `Generate New`: Generate new array, each element will have random value in range [1 - 99].
- `Array size`: The size of array. You can change this value in range [2 - 128].
- `Elements`: The elements in current array. You can custom set each element value in array with value in range [1 - 99].
- `Animation Speed`: Period of each animation step. You can set animation speed with min value is 10 (ms) (this is the fastest case).
- `Start sort | Pause sort | Continue sort`: You can start the sort animation, pause it or continue if you want.

#### 1.2. Search Algorithms 

Sort Algorithms will be executed on an array with 7 features:

- `Shuffle`: Shuffle position of elements in current array.
- `Generate New`: Generate new array, each element will have random value in range [1 - 99].
- `Array size`: The size of array. You can change this value in range [2 - 128].
- `Elements`: The elements in current array. You can custom set each element value in array with value in range [1 - 99].
- `Value searching`: The value which you want to search in current array. You can set this value in range [1- 99].
- `Animation Speed`: Period of each animation step. You can set animation speed with min value is 10 (ms) (this is the fastest case).
- `Start sort | Pause sort | Continue sort`: You can start the sort animation, pause it or continue if you want.

#### 1.3. Data Structures

Data Structures will have 3 features:

- `Animation Speed`: Period of each animation step. You can set animation speed with min value is 500 (ms) (this is the fastest case).
- `Choose Action`: You can choose a method of current data structure which you want to see visualization
  - List: Have 5 actions `add(value)`, `add(index, value)`, `get(index)`, `remove(index)`, `remove(value)`
  - Stack: Have 2 actions `push(value)`, `pop()`
  - Queue: Have 2 actions `enqueue(value)`, `dequeue()`
  - Priority Queue: Have 2 actions `insert(key, value)`, `removeMin()`
  - Tree: Have 8 actions includes `6 traversal methods`, `insert(value)`, `delete(value)`
- `Run Action`: Run animation with selected method. When you started animation, you can't pause it.
